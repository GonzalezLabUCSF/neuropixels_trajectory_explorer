# LAB Specific guidelines

## Getting Started

1. **Clone repository/Download the zip file**

You can get started with the zebra finch neuropixel trajectory explorer either by download the whole repository or cloning using the following git command
```
git clone https://github.com/GonzalezLabUCSF/neuropixels_trajectory_explorer.git
```

2. **Download/Clone npy-matlab repository**
   Download npy-matlab library using the following link https://git3.hub.com/kwikteam/npy-matlab
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/kwikteam/npy-matlab.git
   ```
4. **Setup path**
   Chage the npy-matlab and atlas path relative to your computer's path
   
   

 
6. **Run zebra finch neuropixel trajectory explorer**

   In matlab command window run the following command

# Neuropixels trajectory explorer
Neuropixels trajectory explorer with the Allen CCF mouse atlas 

There is also a Waxholm rat atlas version available, though this is not actively maintained.

The program does not require any specific software. It was written and can be run from MATLAB, but included is a standalone version that does not require MATLAB to run.

**Features:**
  * Plan trajectories to target brain regions with one or more Neuropixels probes
  * Interface with New Scale manipulators to have a live visual of trajectories and recorded areas during an experiment
  * Display brain regions alongside data during recording (in Open Ephys or SpikeGLX)

**For a demo, see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54VHDqzowwY&ab_channel=MatteoCarandini) (part of the [2023 UCL Neuropixels Course](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/neuropixels/training/2023-neuropixels-course))**
